This app is a react-native app. It requires the user of the app to create a group, thereby adding members based on their phone numbers. Once the group is created, the user is expected to add the name of the bill along with the cost of individual user. After clicking on the split button in the app,the app will display the usernames of that particular group  along with costs.
